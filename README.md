# ASAP

## Description
This repository contains the code and documentation to implement the system for selection of pre-trained datasets in the biomedical domain described in the paper:

```
ASAP: an Automated Style-Aware Selection of Pre-training Datasets in 2D Biomedical Imaging
Miguel Molina-Moreno, Marcel P. Schilling, Markus Reischl and Ralf Mikut
IEEE Access (submitted 2023)
```

This code is based on the implementation by [Julian Stastny](https://github.com/julianstastny/VAE-ResNet18-PyTorch/blob/master/model.py) et al.
and the code and model by [@Horizon2333](https://github.com/Horizon2333/imagenet-autoencoder/).
